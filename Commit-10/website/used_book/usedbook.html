            <p>When you own a book that you really like, a part of you stays in it long after the book has left your 
                shelf and traveled to someone else’s – handed down, stolen, lost or sold. Very often, when people don’t 
                have a book mark handy – they use various things: bus or train tickets, newspaper cuttings, leaves, pocket combs, 
                movie tickets, twigs, hair pins – I have even found a grocery list once and a scribbled note. People forget these 
                pieces of themselves in the books they set free and so they lie there, cocooned, waiting to be discovered by the
                 new owner. I have had several such encounters.</p>
